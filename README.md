📊 Gen AI Project: Log Classification System
Technologies: Deepseek R1 LLM, BERT, NLP, Regex

This project is an intelligent Log Classification System designed to process and categorize unstructured log data using advanced Generative AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

🔧 Features:
✅ Uses Deepseek R1 LLM for contextual understanding of log semantics

📚 Combines BERT embeddings, Regex patterns, and rule-based logic

🏷️ Automatically classifies logs into categories like Info, Warning, Error, Critical, etc.

📥 Supports ingestion of raw logs in plain text or JSON

📈 Scalable and customizable for IT operations, AIOps, and system monitoring use cases

🚀 Use Cases:
Real-time classification of application or system logs

Intelligent filtering for alerting or dashboard systems

Enhancing observability in cloud or DevOps pipelines

This system bridges traditional log parsing with modern GenAI for faster, smarter infrastructure insights.
